# Rock Paper Scissors 

## Description
This project plays a basic game of Rock Paper Scissors. Phase 1 of the project will be developing the javacript code. This phase will collect input using the prompt function and show results in console. Phase 2 will add a graphical user interface with HTML and CSS.

## Phase 1
Created a console version of rock, paper, scissors. I had fun playing with 
the formatting of the console.log() output.  A simple windows prompt was used
to collect the input from the player. The console version can be seen in the console folder.

I may have gone a little overboard with the use of functions.

## Phase 2
Added a browser base UI. In addition to the clicking the buttons, I added 
keyboard shortcuts, which included a quit option to end the match early.

I added a table to track the results of each round. The table columns with the 
scores are added by javascript each round and removed when the game resets

The final version of the game can be seen here, [Rock Paper Scissors game](https://plaustralcl.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).
