# Rock Paper Scissors 

## Overall Description
This project is part of [The Odin Project's Foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors). It plays a basic game of Rock Paper Scissors. Phase 1 of the project developed the javacript code to play the game 
in the console. The focus was on using javascript to implement the logic of the 
game. This phase will collect input using the prompt function and show results in console. Phase 2 added a graphical user interface with HTML and CSS. The project description
for [phase 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation) is found in a separate lesson in The Odin Project.

## Phase 1
Created a console version of rock, paper, scissors. I had fun playing with 
the formatting of the console.log() output.  A simple windows prompt was used
to collect the input from the player.

### Notable items for Phase 1
  1. First javascript program
  2. It was interactive! Only through the console and a prompt, but still interactive
  3. I learned a lot about formatting the appearance of the output to the console.


## Phase 2
For this phase, I added a browser base UI. In addition to the clicking the buttons, I added 
keyboard shortcuts, which included a quit option to end the match early.

I added a table to track the results of each round. The table columns with the 
scores are added by javascript each round and removed when the game resets

The final version of the game can be seen here, [Rock Paper Scissors game](https://plaustralcl.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

### Notable items for Phase 2
  1. First browser based UI.
  2. Use of buttons and event listeners
  3. I enjoyed added the keyboard short cut keys to the functionality.
  4. Creating and removing DOM elements as necessary. This is easiest to see 
  in the results table. The table was inspired by the match summary table in Lichess.
  5. Added formatting to the generated text content based on the results of the
  given round and the overall match results.
